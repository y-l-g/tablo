/// Guards the shell-JS hook contract (ADR-0014): every hand-written
/// asset under `crates/tablo-ui/assets/` still exists and stays wired to
/// its `tablo-ui` constant, and every hook in the checked-in
/// [`xtask::ASSET_HOOKS`] list still appears in both its JS asset and a Rust
/// render site. A missing/renamed asset or a rename on either side of a
/// string-selector coupling fails here, because `asset!` does not stat its
/// source at compile time and nothing else checks the JS consumer side.

/// for its example app. Because the sync is byte-for-byte (no string patches,
/// no injected content inside the source), the SYNC header's sha256 is
/// meaningful and drift cannot hide: a hand edit, a stale file, or a missing
/// component fails here until `cargo xtask sync-topcoat-ui` restores it.
