# Panel declares Resources, Shell is implicit

## Decision

`Panel` is the declarative seam:
`Panel::new("admin").resource::<UserResource>().build().expect("panel builds")` discovers
`#[page]`/`#[layout]` via `Router::builder().discover()`, registers each resource's routes (the list
page at `{prefix}/{slug}`), and redirects the panel root to the first resource.
`Panel::page::<P: Page>()` registers a non-resource page at `{prefix}/{slug}`, and
`Panel::home::<P>()` one at the prefix, replacing that redirect (GH #407). An app's layout
delegates to `Panel::layout_shell`, which owns the complete document, so applications carry no
document HTML or `AssetConfig` fallback; `shell_assets(tailwind::stylesheet!(), font)` supplies the
call-site assets the app's Tailwind scan needs, and `Panel::render_shell` stays the low-level
primitive for custom layouts.

`Panel::nav_item` is the one panel-aware navigation seam, and it consumes the resource's
`Resource::navigation()`: the resource owns label, order and grouping, the Panel owns the URL. The
default entry names no URL at all — `NavTarget::Derived` — and the Panel that owns the item resolves
that target from its own mount prefix plus the resource's slug (`{prefix}/{slug}`). An explicit
target (`NavTarget::Url`, which `NavigationItem::at` builds) is kept verbatim, so resolution can
never rewrite a link its author wrote, not even one shaped like `/admin/{slug}`.
`NavigationItem::for_resource` and `for_page` are the derived constructors and `at` the explicit
one, so no public constructor can emit a wrong mount. A `Page` declares its entry through
`Page::navigation()` the same way, and the home page's entry resolves to the prefix itself.
`is_current_path` matches exact paths or slash-boundary prefixes; since the home entry matches every
panel path, the sidebar marks only the matching entry with the longest URL active. An override that
wants a different order sets the `order` field.

## Consequences

An app with one `Resource` gets a Filament-grade shell by delegating its layout to
`Panel::layout_shell`, with zero document or sidebar HTML in application code. `examples/showcase` is
the reference for the asset-loading contract and for typed navigation. `Panel` remains the single
owner of Router/Db/Shell per `CONTEXT.md`.
