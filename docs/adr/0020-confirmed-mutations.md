# Confirmed mutations: the response is a page, the table is re-run by its shard

Date: 2026-09-23 — Status: accepted — Amended: 2026-09-27

## Decision

**A confirmed delete stays a POST that 303s to the list.** The handlers, their policy and
confirmation checks, their flash notification, and the no-JS path are unchanged
(`panel/actions/`, ADR-0004, ADR-0010). What changes is who follows the redirect: a form marked
`data-mutation-submit` — the row-delete confirm and the bulk confirm — is posted by
`crates/tablo-ui/assets/mutation-submit.js` with `fetch`, and the response is applied in place.
Without JavaScript the marker is inert and the same form POSTs and 303s.

**The mutation response is the whole list page, and the client reads exactly two things out of it.**

- **The toast**, because following the redirect consumed the one-time flash cookie that carries it
  (ADR-0010). The response's `[data-sonner-toast]` surfaces are inserted into the shell's toaster.
  They are inserted, never morphed: a morph re-syncs `data-mounted` from the response (`false`) on a
  surface `notifications.js` has already mounted, and its arming observer only sees *added* nodes,
  so the toast would stay hidden.
- **The table**, which it does **not** take from the response on a live table.

**The table is refreshed by the shard that already owns it.** A live table renders a refresh
control inside its region — a hidden `[data-table-revision]` input, declared and read by
`Table::render_inner` when the render is a live one. Writing it changes a signal the `table_search`
shard tracks, so the runtime re-fetches the shard and morphs the region: fresh rows for the *current*
query, markup hydrated by the runtime, and any rerun still in flight cancelled by the runtime's
request controller. The signal is declared inside the shard's own output, so it belongs to the
shard's content scope: its id derives from the shard invocation's identity and its call site, which
makes it stable across reruns and distinct per shard, and the runtime keeps its value when the
declaration renders again. The token is opaque; the client bumps a monotonic counter, because a
same-value signal write schedules nothing.

**A static table's region is replaced wholesale**, because it is inert markup: with no signals there
is no binding, no handler, and no shard (pinned by
`a_static_table_renders_no_runtime_bindings_at_all`). The control's presence is therefore the page's
own answer to "can this table refresh in place?", and the client needs no other test.

**The client finds the table from the form, not from the document.** The bulk form lives inside its
table's `[data-table-root]`; the row confirm lives in the dialog the page owns, outside every table,
so its table is the one holding the control that opened it — the control carries the same POST target
`dialog.js` copies onto the form. A target that matches no control resolves to no table, and the
client then leaves the page to the browser. Both paths read the region, the refresh control and the
bulk transport through that one root, so a page rendering two tables cannot have one table's delete
touch the other's.

**The client never morphs the response into the live document.** The reason is state, not markup:

- **The response renders the bare list URL, the page keeps its live state.** A delete 303s to
  `list_url(cx, slug)` — prefix and slug, no query (`panel/gate.rs`). A live table's query state
  lives in its signals and in the page-owned toolbar, both *outside* `[data-boundary="table"]`, and
  the client can neither read them (only `q`, `filters` and `bulk` have DOM transports; `sort`,
  `dir`, `cursor` and `group_by` are registry-only) nor reset them. Morphing the region would leave
  a table showing page 1 unfiltered under a toolbar still reading `?q=ada`, and the next shard rerun
  would snap the table back to the query the toolbar no longer shows.

A hand-written morph would also start its inserted nodes unbound — the runtime exposes no morph or
hydrate entry point, so a sort or pager link a morph inserts falls back to its `href` until the next
rerun, which re-hydrates the whole range it morphs (`ShardUnit.insert` morphs and then hydrates;
`hydrate` re-attaches every `data-topcoat-on:*` handler it walks). That is a transient downgrade, not
a reason to reject the morph; the state above is.

**Failure paths stay the browser's.** A POST the server answers itself (4xx/5xx) wrote nothing — the
handlers verify CSRF and confirmation and check policy before opening the write, and any failure
rolls the transaction back — so the client hands the form back with `form.submit()` and the browser
shows the same response a no-JS POST would, at the same URL. Two cases reload instead, because
posting again would be a second write: a request that never completes (the outcome is unknown) and a
redirect that was followed but whose list render failed (the delete committed; only the render behind
it did not).

**What the swap preserves.** The URL keeps the state the table still holds; only the dialog's own
`delete`/`open` parameters are dropped (a static table mirrors the response URL, whose state its
region now shows). The bulk selection is pruned by exactly the keys the write removed — the batch a
bulk form carried, or the record a row action names — and written back through the transport, so a
row delete leaves the rest of the selection standing while a batch clears it. Focus moves to the row
that took the deleted row's place (its own Delete control first), else the bulk trigger; a modal
dialog is closed by the client *before* the rerun, because a dialog the response's markup closes by
dropping `open` strands the document inert.

## Consequences

`Table::render_inner`'s live branch declares one extra signal per shard and renders one hidden input;
the shard's wire arguments and `TableSignals` are unchanged, and a mutation carries no markup. The
`table_search` shard re-runs on a write it did not have before, so a mutation costs one shard request
in addition to the POST it always made. `mutation-submit.js` joins the shell assets (ADR-0014) with
`data-mutation-submit`, `data-table-revision`, `data-boundary` and `data-sonner-toaster` as its hook
contract, and its pure decisions — which region a response hands over, which keys a write removed,
which submits it answers — are covered by `node --test`. `Table::live_search` defaults to false, so
the shard path is the one a resource opts into: all four showcase resources do, and every other
table — a downstream app's included — takes the wholesale replacement, which is exercised only by
suppressing the control on a live page.

A page that renders a live table without a shard around it (`Table::render_live_with_state`, GH #154
§2) carries the same control, but its dependency attaches to the page unit instead: writing it
re-runs the page, not a shard. That rerun re-renders the whole document, and its morph drops the
toast the client just inserted — the response carries none (the flash was consumed), and the toast
sits before the toaster shard's start marker, outside the content the morph keeps.
