# Media uploads: an app-level `Uploader` and a clear control

Date: 2026-09-22 — Status: accepted — Amended: 2026-09-22, 2026-09-23, 2026-09-24, 2026-09-25

## Decision

**The seam is an app-level trait, not a per-field declaration.**
`Uploader::store(filename, bytes) -> Result<String, String>`, installed once with
`Panel::uploads(uploader)` and found on the app context the way `Db` is — an object store is an app
dependency, and threading it through every `.for(..)` call site would put infrastructure in the schema
declaration. The public trait returns `impl Future` (the house style, no `async_trait`), and a private
dyn-compatible shim holds it so `Panel` does not become generic over the app's store. The request side
is the framework's already: the 10 MiB body cap, the multipart stream, and filename sanitization to a
basename.

**Bytes are buffered, not streamed to the store,** because the body cap already bounds memory; the
buffer is taken only when an uploader is installed, so with none the parser keeps draining and
discarding. **A refusal is user input, not infrastructure:** `Err(reason)` renders
`"<Label> could not be uploaded: <reason>"` against the field and re-renders the form with the
submitted values — the framework owns the sentence, the uploader owns the reason, and the reason is
printed to the user, so never a driver message or a path. **The framework stores the returned string
verbatim and renders it verbatim:** the field still binds a `String`, the record fn's contract is
unchanged, and a stored value renders as a link to the file — on the edit form and on the detail
page. The field reads no extension and owns no image pipeline, so it neither previews a path nor
guesses a URL convention (GH #242). **A file field's value comes only from a file part** — the
uploader's answer, or the sanitized basename with no uploader — from the stored value on an untouched
edit, or empty on `clear_<field>`; text a client typed under the field's name is dropped (GH #277).
**A form that re-renders with errors carries the path its store just answered** in a hidden
`keep_<field>` control, and the next submit re-uses it only when `Uploader::holds(path)` confirms the
store still has it (GH #297): the value still originates in the store, so the carry does not widen
the GH #277 rule. `holds` is defaulted and answers `false` — no carry, the behaviour of a store that
does not implement it — and its contract is ownership rather than existence: `true` only for a path
the store itself produced and resolves inside its own root, never for a client-supplied path, or it
becomes a path-traversal gate.
**A stored value renders as a link only when it is rooted (`/…`, not `//host`) or an absolute
`http(s)://…` URL**, and as text otherwise, so a stored scheme cannot become a clickable `href`.

**The primitive stops at the file input.** A thumbnail in the stored row, an × that clears the input
and the preview, drag-and-drop and upload progress are media-library work: the showcase renders the
first two (GH #248, ADR-0021) from its own `medias` table and its own asset, drag-and-drop and
progress stay unbuilt, and a generic `String`-bound field is the wrong place to guess any of them.

**The clear control is a declared transport key.** A file field renders a `clear_<field>` checkbox
whenever a value is stored, alongside the hint that an empty file input keeps what is there.
Strip-before-record-fn (GH #148) is unchanged, so a generic `Resource` impl still cannot be handed the
flag as a write. Clearing does not waive `required`: the value is empty, the ordinary required error
answers, and the record keeps its file — a resource that may lose its file declares `.optional()`.

**`Panel::serve_dir(path, dir)` mounts an app-owned directory** on the panel's router, the app's only
way to add a route the framework does not own. The passthrough is deliberately narrow (upstream's
`serve_dir`, path pattern included) rather than a general route hook, and the path is not
panel-relative: a served directory holds files a record points at, not panel pages, and its URLs must
not move when the panel is mounted elsewhere. A served directory is **public by decision** (GH #225):
the auth gate installs exactly two layers — the panel prefix and `/_topcoat/runtime` (ADR-0013) — so a
directory mounted outside both is ungated by construction. Public media is a legitimate shape, and
gating a served directory remains a possible future option; the rule for apps is that a directory meant
to be private is mounted behind the app's own gate, never assumed private from the mount path.
`a_served_directory_is_reachable_without_a_session` in `crates/tablo-core/tests/uploads.rs` pins
the anonymous case.

**A served directory is public and inert** (GH #278): because it shares the panel's origin, every file
response the directory route serves carries `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and a fixed sandboxing
`Content-Security-Policy`, and `Content-Disposition: attachment` unless the `Content-Type` is a
common raster image, audio/video or `text/plain` — an app that serves active documents mounts them on
its own origin, since the policy is not configurable. A 404 keeps Topcoat's `text/plain` error page;
a 405 carries only `Allow` and an empty body. Neither carries user content.

Uploads run **before** the write transaction and outside it: an upload is a side effect in another
system, and a rolled-back transaction must not have to undo it. A file stored for a form that then
fails validation is unreferenced, not wrong, and a store with a real write cost wants its own janitor.

## Consequences

- An app that never installs an `Uploader` stores the sanitized basename; a bare basename is not
  rooted, so the stored value renders as text rather than a link (GH #277).
- A cleared upload empties the stored value, not the bytes: the framework cannot delete from a store
  it does not know. An app that wants the bytes gone acts on the empty value its record fn receives.
- A rejected store drops the submitted value rather than blanking it, which is why the edit handler
  stores before it backfills: a re-rendered edit shows the file still on disk, and a re-rendered create
  shows an empty field beside the reason.
- The showcase demonstrates the whole path: `DirUploader` writes into a served directory, the record
  stores the returned URL, and the URL fetches the bytes back (GH #188).
- `tablo-core` enables topcoat's `fs` feature, which upstream's directory route lives behind, and
  both lockfiles carry the crates it pulls. Image handling (thumbnails, transcoding, dimensions) and
  storage drivers stay out of scope: the field links a stored path, and the trait is the seam for the
  bytes.
