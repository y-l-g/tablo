# Tables

The list view: columns and the row key, search and sort, filters, grouping and CSV export, live
updates, and row and bulk delete.

Minimal table:

```rust
Table::new(
    |u: &User| u.id.to_string(),
    (
        TextColumn::r#for(User::fields().name(), |u: &User| u.name.clone())
            .searchable()
            .sortable(),
        TextColumn::computed("Status", |u: &User| {
            if u.active { "Active".into() } else { "Inactive".into() }
        }),
    ),
)
.paginate(20)
```

Notes:

- `Table::new(key, columns)` declares the row key and the record key together: the row key
  keys rows for selection and live updates — never use a loop index — and the record key is
  what action URLs and bulk checkbox values carry. Handlers resolve the record key as the
  model's typed primary key, so declare the primary key, not a display label: a non-PK
  projection makes every delete and bulk submit 404. A table whose display must stay a
  non-PK value uses `Table::new_split(display, record, columns)`, which carries the typed
  primary key in the URLs instead.
- `searchable()` searches with `?q=`: an escaped substring match (`like_with_escape`, OR across
  searchable columns), so a term containing `%` or `_` matches those characters literally. `LIKE` is
  ASCII-case-insensitive on SQLite and case-sensitive on PostgreSQL. `sortable()` sorts with
  `?sort=` and `?dir=`. Both work without JS.
- The URL is the state: `?q=`, `?sort=`, `?dir=`, `?after=`, `?before=`, `?filters=`, `?group_by=`
  parse into `TableState`. Pagination is cursor based; Toasty appends the PK tie-breaker internally
  so cursors stay deterministic.
- Columns render in a fixed layout (`table-fixed`): a column's width is the one its header declares, not
  the widest cell on the current page, so filtering, sorting or paging never re-measures the columns.
  Widths are percentages of the table, so what a table declares is a share of its container rather than a
  length that can outgrow it. The default follows the column's kind: a field column
  (`TextColumn::r#for`) declares nothing and takes what the declared columns leave, a computed column
  (`TextColumn::computed`) claims a share (10% nominally). The chrome columns — bulk selection, row
  actions — claim shares too, and the kind defaults scale down together when their total would leave the
  field columns less than 40% of the table. `TextColumn::width(ColumnWidth::..)` overrides either; an
  explicit `Rem` does not shrink with the table, so a table narrower than its lengths leaves the field
  columns no space at all. The width is emitted as an inline `style` — Tailwind generates only the class
  literals it finds in source — and a value wider than its column truncates with an ellipsis.
- A `w-full` table never exceeds its container on its own, so on a narrow viewport the percentages
  would crush the cells instead of scrolling: the table carries a `min-width` summing its declared
  widths (shares as emitted, lengths verbatim, one readability floor per wide column, a content floor on
  the actions column), and the wrapper's `overflow-x-auto` scrolls once the table is wider than its
  container. The actions column pairs its share with that floor on its header and cells, so the row
  buttons fit instead of spilling past the table.
- Relation tables on detail pages follow the same fixed-layout rule: `table-fixed`, a `ColumnWidth`
  per column (default `Wide`, so a default table declares no widths and splits evenly),
  `truncate` on every cell, and a `min-width` summing the shares plus one readability floor per wide
  column, so the wrapper scrolls on a narrow viewport instead of collapsing an undeclared column.
  `RelationColumn::width(ColumnWidth::..)` overrides the default; an explicit `Rem` behaves as on
  the list, leaving wide columns no space when the lengths exceed the table.
- Computed columns render only. They do not affect search or sort.

Filters:

```rust
.filters((
    SelectFilter::r#for(Post::fields().status(), vec!["draft".into(), "published".into()]),
    TernaryFilter::r#for(Post::fields().featured()),
    DateFilter::r#for(Post::fields().created_at()),
))
```

Active filters travel in `?filters=` and combine with AND. Unknown keys and rejected values never
fail silently: the list renders a `role=alert` banner (`Table::unapplied_filters`) while export
refuses with 400.

Grouping and export:

```rust
.group_by("status", |p: &Post| p.status.clone())
```

- Grouping is page-local with a row count per group. Toasty has no `GROUP BY` yet, so grouping never
  claims full-table totals. Unknown `?group_by=` values render no headers and drop from nav links.
- `GET /admin/{slug}/export` returns the filtered set as CSV (`text/csv; charset=utf-8` +
  `Content-Disposition`, RFC4180 with OWASP formula-defusing), reusing the same filters and sort over
  `export_query` — the base `query` unless the resource narrows it to the includes its columns
  declared (GH #177). Capped at 10k viewable rows: per-row `can_view` runs before the cap, so 413
  reflects what the caller may receive. An export whose filtered set runs past the 10,001-row scan
  window is a 413 too, even when fewer rows would be viewable: the export never returns a partial
  file. `?bom=1` opts into an Excel BOM.
- Failed table loads render the branded `ErrorState` in-region, not a blank page.

Live updates:

```rust
Table::new(|u: &User| u.id.to_string(), columns).live_search(true)
```

Search, sort, filter, and pager controls then refresh the table in place without a full page load.
The plain links and forms stay as the no-JS fallback.

Panel wires the bulk checkbox column when the resource opts in with `deletable() -> true` (GH #226:
chrome is opt-in, and the flag pairs with `can_view` + `can_delete`). The column then follows those
predicates per record (GH #235): a row either one refuses renders no checkbox,
so select-all never submits a key the handler would refuse
the whole batch over. A row refused every action keeps an empty actions cell,
so the row keeps a cell per header. Bulk delete asks first: the bulk bar's
button opens an alert dialog that names how many rows are selected, and its confirm control is the
only thing carrying the `confirm=1` the handler requires — a POST without that marker is a 400, so
the safeguard does not depend on the script that opens the dialog (GH #184).

Row delete asks first too, and the dialog opens in place (GH #233): the row control names the
table's one dialog and carries that record's POST target. Confirming it needs no navigation
(GH #234): the client follows the POST's 303, mounts the flash toast the handler set, and refreshes
the table through the shard — a delete costs the confirmed POST, the list render behind the redirect
(whose body is discarded except the toast) and one `table_search` request. Cancel is a button, so
dismissing never navigates; the control's `?delete=<key>` href stays as the no-JS fallback, which
renders the same dialog open with the action already set.
