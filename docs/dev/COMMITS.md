# Commit messages

Every branch is squash-merged into `master`: one commit per branch, so the
history has no empty merge commits. A branch's individual commits are working
notes.

The squashed commit is a Conventional Commit. When the change closes an
issue, keep its reference in the subject — it is what links the history back
to the tracker. Changes with no issue need none.

```
<type>(<scope>): <description> (#123)
```

No line of the commit message is longer than 100 characters. This keeps messages
readable on GitHub and in git tools. Pull request titles follow the same format,
since the title becomes the squashed commit; reviewers check it.

## Types

`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `chore`, `build`,
`ci`, `revert`.

## Subject

The subject is a succinct description of the change:

- imperative, present tense: "add" not "added" nor "adds"
- begins with a lowercase letter
- no trailing period
- ends with the issue reference `(#123)` when the change closes an issue

## Scope

The subsystem the change touches: `table`, `panel`, `schema`, `core`, `ui`,
`xtask`, `showcase`, `docs`, `repo`.

Several issues list them all (omit the reference when there is no issue):

```
fix(table): bound the filters signal (#205, #219)
```

## Breaking changes

Mark a breaking change with `!` after the type or the scope, and explain it in a
`BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:

```
feat(schema)!: choose an embedded enum's variant in the form (#191)

BREAKING CHANGE: an embedded enum's discriminant is now visible, and
`discriminant_input` / the hidden control are replaced by `discriminant_select`.
```

## Body

Explain what changed and why it changed. Do not restate the diff, and do not
narrate the path that produced it — describe the change the commit makes.
Write the body per [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#prose): current behavior, active
voice, no filler.
