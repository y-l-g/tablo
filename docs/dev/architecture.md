# Architecture

How the crates fit together, what happens on a request, and where the extension points are.
`CONTEXT.md` defines the vocabulary; `docs/guide/` explains how to use the toolkit.

## Crates

`tablo-macros` and `tablo-ui` are leaves. `tablo-core` depends on both, and the showcase
depends on `tablo-core` and `tablo-ui`.

| Crate | Depends on | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tablo-macros` | — | the `EmbeddedForm` and `RecordForm` derives |
| `tablo-ui` | `topcoat` | synced primitives, owned composites, `icons.rs` |
| `tablo-core` | `tablo-macros`, `tablo-ui`, `toasty` | Panel, Resource, Table, Schema, auth, tenancy, upload |
| `examples/showcase` | `tablo-core`, `tablo-ui`, `toasty` | the runnable admin and the integration tests |

`tablo-core` never depends on a concrete database driver. Everything reaches the database through
Toasty's `Db` and `Executor`, which is why an app-level `Uploader` and the `Authenticator` are traits
the app implements rather than crates the toolkit picks.

## The layering

```
Panel  ──declares──▶  Resource  ──declares──▶  Table   (the list view)
   │                      │                  └▶  Schema  (forms, detail pages)
   │                      └──record fns─────▶  create / update / delete
   └──owns──▶ Router, Db in app context, Shell, the auth gate
```

A `Panel` owns the router, the `Db` in app context, the shell layout, and the authentication gate.
Registering a `Resource` on it adds that resource's routes and its sidebar entry. A `Resource` maps
one Toasty model to its admin UI: a base query, a `Table`, a `Schema`, a policy, and the record
functions that perform writes.

`Table` and `Schema` are declarations, not renderers. `Panel::build` calls `table()` and `form()` once
per registered resource with a Db-only context to check the declaration, and each list or form request
calls `table()` / `form()` again to render. Because the build check has only the Db, a declaration must
not need request-scoped context; one that cannot render fails `Panel::build` rather than a request.

## A read request

A resource list page runs, in order:

1. `enforce_auth(cx)` — resolve the session, or redirect to the login page.
2. `enforce_tenant::<R>(cx)` — refuse with 403 when `R::requires_tenant()` and the request has no
   tenant.
3. `R::can_view_any(cx)` — the list-level policy check, before any row is loaded.
4. Parse `TableState` from the URL (`?q=`, `?sort=`, `?dir=`, `?after=`, `?filters=`, `?group_by=`).
5. Load through `scoped_query_with::<R>(cx, &table.include_needs())` — `R::query_with(cx, needs)`
   with the framework's tenant filter ANDed on — so the list loads the includes its columns declared.
6. Render the table inside a `suspense` region: the skeleton is sent with the shell, the loaded rows
   swap in.

The list checks `can_view_any` only, so pagination stays honest; per-row `can_view` trims the export
and the relationship option lists. A detail page loads through `scoped_query` — the full base query,
because `view_relations` has no include declaration — so an unknown id and one outside the tenant are
the same 404, while a row the caller may not view is a 403.

## A write request

Create, update, delete, and bulk delete run the same shape:

1. `enforce_auth`, `enforce_tenant`, and the matching `can_*` check.
2. For a form: on an edit, complete the keys the submission did not post from the stored record;
   then validate, which also resolves relationship fields against the related resource's query.
3. Open a framework-owned transaction and re-load the target through the scoped query, so policy is
   checked against the row that is about to be written rather than the submitted id.
4. For a form: re-complete the unposted keys from that row, run the unique probe, parse the values
   into the resource's record form, and run `validate_record`; any error re-renders the form.
5. Call the resource's record function inside that transaction.
6. Commit, then call `Resource::after_commit(cx, committed)`.

Every POST carries a double-submit CSRF token, and a bulk delete additionally requires the
`confirm=1` marker that only the confirm control emits. The record functions are the mutation
vocabulary; a non-CRUD operation is a record function or a hand-written page.

`after_commit` is the only place for a side effect that must not survive a rollback — email, a
webhook, an audit row. It runs after the transaction and before the response, it runs once per
committed write, and a failure in it is logged without rolling the write back.

## Extension points

| Seam | Where | What it decides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Resource::query` | `resource/mod.rs` | the resource's own row scoping: soft deletes, row-level visibility, includes |
| `Resource::tenant_scope` | `tenancy.rs` | the tenant predicate, derived from the model's `tenant_id` by default |
| `Resource::export_query` | `resource/mod.rs` | the export's base query, narrowed to the includes its columns declared |
| `Resource::can_*` | `resource/mod.rs` | authorization, default deny |
| `Resource::editable` / `deletable` | `resource/mod.rs` | whether the row chrome renders, default off |
| `schema::OptionSource` | `schema/relationship.rs` | what a relationship select offers, and who may see it |
| `EmbeddedForm` | `tablo-macros` | the flat form map ↔ a typed embedded value |
| `RecordForm` / `FormResource` | `form.rs` | the typed value a form writes, and the create and update record fns |
| `Uploader` | `upload.rs` | where a `FileUpload`'s bytes go |
| `Authenticator` | `auth.rs` | how credentials resolve to a `CurrentUser` |
| `Table::new` / `Table::new_split` | `resource/table/mod.rs` | row identity for keyed diffs and for action URLs |
| `panel::wired_table` | `panel/mod.rs` | the wired list table a page-owned table renders |

Row identity is two projections. `Table::new` takes one key projection and uses it for both halves:
the display key that drives keyed diffs and DOM ids, and the record key that handlers
resolve as the model's typed primary key. A table whose display projects a non-PK value
splits them with `Table::new_split(display, record, columns)`.

## Reactivity

The toolkit ships no client framework. Two Topcoat mechanisms cover the interactive parts:

- **`suspense`** streams a region's content after the first render. The resource list uses it so the
  page shell and skeleton arrive first and the table swaps in.
- **Shards** re-render a region in place. A table with `Table::live_search(true)` hands its chrome to
  the page's `TableSignals`: search, sort, filters, and pagination write signals, the shard re-renders
  the table, and Topcoat morphs the result in place so focus and scroll survive.

Page and layout guards do not run on a shard request, so a shard authorizes itself. Renders are
side-effect free and deterministic: no `HashMap` iteration, no `Utc::now()`, no random ids in a
streamed region.

## Assets

`tablo-ui` owns ten browser scripts under `crates/tablo-ui/assets/`. They are loaded through
`asset!`, so they have no build step. Each one is wired to a constant in `tablo-ui/src/lib.rs`,
and a test guards the pairing: `cargo test -p xtask` runs `shell_assets_match_hook_contract`, which
fails when an asset is missing or a hook no longer appears in both its JavaScript and the Rust that
renders it. `asset!` does not read its source at compile time, so nothing else checks the JavaScript
side of that coupling.

`cargo xtask sync-topcoat-ui` re-vendors the components listed in `xtask::VENDORED_PRIMITIVES`
from `topcoat-ui-registry` and writes a content hash into each file header. Those files are never hand-edited;
`cargo xtask verify-topcoat-ui` fails on drift. Components in `components/composites/` are
Tablo's own and are never overwritten.

## Module map

```
crates/tablo-core/src/
  panel/      mod, build, gate, list, forms, actions/{bulk, delete, export, fetch,
              options}, detail, search, shell, headers
  resource/   mod, table/{mod,render,export}, column, state, filter, relation,
              navigation, naming, commit
  schema/     mod, fields, layouts, lenses, tree, relationship, embedded, pk,
              validation
  auth, csrf, cursor, db, notification, query_term, tenancy, upload
```

The three largest modules split along the request shape rather than by type: `panel/` holds the
handlers, `resource/` holds what a resource declares and how a list renders it, and `schema/` holds
the form and detail-page declaration and its rendering.
