//! The live feed: a panel write reaches an open page, and the page marks the
//! WebSocket connection Topcoat opens for the feed's shard.
//!
//! The connection itself is the browser runtime's; what a server-side test can
//! pin is the markup and the wiring behind it — the page renders the rows, the
//! shard asks for the connection (and not the page around it), and a committed
//! write shows up in the feed.
