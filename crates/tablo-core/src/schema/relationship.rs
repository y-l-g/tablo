//! Relationship option loading — bounded, memoized, policy-checked.
//!
//! Every relationship `Select` over one source shares a single bounded
//! load per `(request, tenant)`; policy (`can_view_any`/`can_view` plus
//! the tenant gate) fails the load closed instead of leaking labels.
//!
//! The loaders are generic over [`OptionSource`] — the source surface they
//! read — rather than over `Resource`, so the dependency runs one way:
//! `resource` depends on `schema`, and the blanket impl in
//! [`crate::resource`] makes every `Resource` an option source.
