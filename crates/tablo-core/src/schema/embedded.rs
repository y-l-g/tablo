//! First-class embedded **values**: a typed value and the flat form map,
//! converted in one declared place.
//!
//! Embedded *leaves* bind one column at a time: a lens through an embedded
//! struct, an enum variant, or a `#[document]` resolves to its flattened
//! storage column and a `TextInput` posts it. A **value** converts as a whole.
//! An embedded enum has a discriminant column (Toasty stores the variant
//! there), so the form carries the discriminant explicitly, hydration writes
//! the stored variant, and an edit names the variant it means. Every key comes
//! from the compiled mapping, as it does for a leaf, so the app never spells a
//! flattened name.
//!
//! A payload selects the variant only when the submission carries no
//! discriminant at all (the create form has nothing to hydrate); a
//! `#[shared(..)]` column belongs to several variants and never selects one. A
//! named discriminant always wins, and an unknown one is refused loudly.
//!
//! # What an app writes
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[derive(Clone, toasty::Embed, tablo_core::EmbeddedForm)]
//! pub struct Seo { pub title: String, pub description: String }
//!
//! Section::new("SEO").schema(Seo::form(cx, Post::fields().seo()));
//! write_embedded(cx, Post::fields().seo(), &record.seo, &mut values);
//! let seo = read_embedded(cx, Post::fields().seo(), &values)?;
//! ```
//!
//! # What is not covered
//!
//! A `#[document]` inside an embedded value (its fields share one column, so no
//! per-field binding; leaf binding of a document still works), a relation
//! inside one, and an embedded enum nested inside an enum variant. Nesting
//! inside *structs* works at any depth. The variant control is a `Select` over
//! the discriminant column ([`discriminant_select`]), each variant's payload
//! renders in a `Group` marked with
//! [`Group::variant`](crate::schema::Group::variant), and `variant.js` toggles
//! them; with JavaScript off every group renders.
//!
//! Every leaf under an embedded step is **not required** by default: the
//! resolver reports `nullable=true` by binding policy, since only the matching
//! variant writes a variant payload column. That is the binding default, not a
//! storage fact — the flattened column of a required embedded struct is
//! `NOT NULL`. A leaf that must be present says so on the field's type, or the
//! app marks the control in its own layout.
