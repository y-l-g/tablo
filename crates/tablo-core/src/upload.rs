//! Where uploaded bytes go: the `Uploader` seam, and the one place
//! the framework hands bytes to it.
//!
//! A file field ([`Field::file`](crate::Field::file)) binds a `String` column, the panel renders a
//! file input, and the form parser decodes the multipart body — but *where* the bytes live and
//! what path the record stores is the app's decision: an object store, a
//! directory on disk, a CDN. The framework owns everything up to the bytes and
//! nothing after them, so this module is deliberately small: a trait, the app
//! context value that carries it, and the call that runs it.
