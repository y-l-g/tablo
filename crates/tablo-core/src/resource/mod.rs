/// # Contract
///
/// **Every method has a default**, so a resource compiles the moment it
/// declares a [`Model`](Self::Model) — and an omission must fail loudly
/// rather than silently:
///
/// - **Checked at [`Panel::build`](crate::panel::Panel::build)**: the table must declare columns
///   and a row key, and with [`can_create`](Self::can_create) the [`form`](Self::form) must declare
///   fields. `table`, `form` and `can_create` are declarations and take no request context, because
///   build checks them with a Db-only context.
/// - **Loud at request time**: the record fns ([`create_record`](Self::create_record),
///   [`update_record`](Self::update_record), [`delete_record`](Self::delete_record)) default to an
///   error naming the type, so a resource that never implemented delete says so instead of writing
///   nothing quietly. [`bulk_delete_records`](Self::bulk_delete_records) loops `delete_record` by
///   default, so it stays loud through the same stub.
/// - **Opt-in chrome, gated per record**: [`deletable`](Self::deletable) and
///   [`editable`](Self::editable) are whole-resource flags, false by default; see
///   [`deletable`](Self::deletable) for how the row predicates narrow them.
/// - **Default-deny is untouched**: every `can_*` defaults to `false`, so an unconfigured resource
///   exposes no data and no mutation.
