//! S2 — the Toasty + SQLite seam: the workspace's `toasty` dependency (with

//! in-memory database.
//!
//! The one measurement here is the database's collation against the app-side
//! unique probe.

/// Is there a **collation
/// disagreement** between the app-side unique check and this database?
///
/// The check probes with the Toasty `eq` filter and skips an edit's unchanged
/// value by comparing trimmed strings — both case-sensitive operations. That
/// only disagrees with the database if the `#[unique]` index compares
/// case-insensitively. Two measurements pin the answer for this configuration:
///
/// 1. The `eq` probe finds the row by its exact stored value, so the probe and the index look at
///    equality the same way.
/// 2. `Alice@example.com` inserts *beside* `alice@example.com`, so the index treats the two as
///    distinct values.
///
/// Together: SQLite's default `BINARY` collation is case- and accent-sensitive,
/// which is exactly what the panel promises — the constraint can reject a
/// duplicate the probe missed only if the column is declared with a
/// non-`BINARY` collation, and no Tablo declaration (or Toasty field
/// attribute) sets one. The test is the record of that finding, so a future
/// driver change that flips the default fails here instead of in production, a
/// second empty submit at a time (item 1).
