// Unit test for the confirmed-mutation wiring in `mutation-submit.js`.
//
// There is no JS test runner in this workspace — the assets are plain browser
// scripts loaded through `asset!` — so this runs on Node's built-in runner and
// reaches the functions through the guarded `module.exports` at the bottom of
// the script:
//
//     node --test crates/tablo-ui/assets/mutation-submit.test.js
//
// What it protects: which region a mutation response hands over (the rendered
// table inside the streamed swap envelope, never the loading skeleton the
// response also carries), which toast surfaces mount, which keys a write
// removed from the bulk selection, which submits this script answers at all —
// a form the page cannot serve must keep the browser's own submit — and what
// it does with a response the server answered itself: the fetched page is
// shown in place, and the mutation is not posted again.
//
// The DOM half of the script (the shard re-render, `DOMParser`) has no
// stand-in here; it is verified against a running panel instead. The fetch
// stand-in below covers the failure branch, which is where the re-send lived.
