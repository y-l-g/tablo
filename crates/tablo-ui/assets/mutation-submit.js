// Confirmed destructive submits, applied without a navigation.
//
// A form marked `data-mutation-submit` — the row-delete confirm and the bulk
// confirm — POSTs through `fetch`, follows the 303, and applies the response
// in place:
//
// - the flash toast the handler set (`set_notification`) is inserted into the
//   shell's toaster, because following the redirect consumed the cookie that
//   carries it;
// - the table is refreshed through the seam that already owns it. A live
//   table renders a revision control inside its region (`[data-table-revision]`,
//   GH #234): writing it re-runs the `table_search` shard, which morphs and
//   re-hydrates the region with the live query state intact. A static table
//   has no shard and its region is inert markup, so the response's region
//   content replaces it wholesale.
//
// The mutation response is a whole list page, and the client never morphs it
// into the live document. The response renders the bare list URL while a live
// table's state lives in its signals and its page-owned toolbar, so a region
// taken from it would show a different result set than the controls around it;
// and markup a plain script inserts carries no bindings until the next shard
// rerun, which re-hydrates the range it morphs. Driving the shard keeps one
// renderer — the server — for both halves.
//
// Failure paths are the browser's. A mutation whose response the client
// fetched is never posted again: a POST the server answers itself (4xx/5xx)
// may already have committed the write — a failure after the commit is still a
// failure response — so the fetched response is rendered into the document,
// the same page a no-JS POST would have shown, and what to do next is the
// reader's to decide. A request that never completes leaves the outcome
// unknown, and a redirect that was followed is a write that landed even when
// the list render behind it failed: both reload the page rather than post the
// delete a second time.
//
// Without JavaScript none of this runs: the same form POSTs and 303s.
//
// Document-level delegation (like bulk.js) so a table a shard re-rendered
// needs no re-installation.
